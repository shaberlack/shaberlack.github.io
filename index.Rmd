This is a [link](https://www.google.com/) to a good data science tool. Here's a [link](https://p8105.com/index.html) to p8105. Here's a link to the [about](about.html) on this site.

You can also still use R!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = runif(100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )

plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
