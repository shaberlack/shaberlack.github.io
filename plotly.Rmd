# Plotly

We're making interactive plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

Focos on NYC Airbnb data.
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  select(borough = neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, stars, price, room_type, lat, long) |> 
 drop_na(stars) |> 
  filter(
    borough == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
    )
```

Let's make a scatterplot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating:", stars)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, text = ~text_label,
          type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5)
```

Let's make a box plot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |> 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

Let's make a bar plot!

How many airbnbs are in each of the neighborhoods we're looking at?
First, sort the dataframe that's going into plot.ly.
(I would use a fct_reorder and a colorscheme).
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  count(neighbourhood) |> 
   mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, type = "bar", color = ~neighbourhood, colors = "viridis")
```
