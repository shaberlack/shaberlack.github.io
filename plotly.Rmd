# Plotly

We're making interactive plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

Focus on NYC Restaurant Inspection data in Queens.
```{r}
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec_Q = rest_inspec |> 
janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(boro == "QUEENS", critical_flag == "Critical") |> 
   separate(inspection_date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> 
  select(-camis, -day, -phone, -grade_date, -building, -record_date) |> 
  mutate(violation_description = case_match(violation_description,
    "Cold food item held above 41Âº F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ÂºF) except during necessary preparation." ~ "Not cold enough", 
    "Food contact surface not properly washed, rinsed and sanitized after each use and following any activity when contamination may have occurred." ~ "Cross-contamination",
    "Filth flies or food/refuse/sewage-associated (FRSA) flies present in facilitys food and/or non-food areas. Filth flies include house flies, little house flies, blow flies, bottle flies and flesh flies. Food/refuse/sewage-associated flies include fruit flies, drain flies and Phorid flies." ~ "FRSA",
    "Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas." ~ "Mice",
    "Food not protected from potential source of contamination during storage, preparation, transportation, display or service." ~ "Food storage safety",
    "Hot food item not held at or above 140Âº F." ~ "Not hot enough",
    "Wiping cloths soiled or not stored in sanitizing solution." ~ "Wiping cloths",
    "Sanitized equipment or utensil, including in-use food dispensing utensil, improperly used or stored." ~ "Utensil cleanliness")) |> 
  drop_na(grade, violation_description)
```

Let's make a scatterplot!

```{r}
rest_inspec_Q |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Cuisine Type:", cuisine_description, "\nGrade:", grade)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~score, y = ~zipcode, color = ~score, text = ~text_label,
          type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5)
```

Let's make a box plot!

```{r}
rest_inspec_Q |>
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |> 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

Let's make a bar plot!

```{r}
rest_inspec_Q |> 
  count(violation_description) |> 
   mutate(violation_description = fct_reorder(violation_description, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~violation_description, y = ~n, type = "bar", color = ~violation_description, colors = "viridis")
```
